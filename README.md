# FunWithSound
 Used to process sound files of various types and goes along with a related article on https://motordocai.io
 The included sound file is for a 125kV to 13.8kV, 12,500 kVA transformer at a manufacturing facility that 
 has high harmonic conditions and poor power factor.  Reference IEEE Standard C57.136-2000, "IEEE Guide for Sound Level
 Abatement and Determination for Liquid-Immersed Power Transformers and Shunt Reactors," which includes definitions
 of different sound frequencies associated with spectral analysis.

 Data from a Samsung A51 phone (video converted to wav), although any wav file can be processed.

 Just for fun.  Systems used for analyzing these types of faults are more complex.

 The sound file used is also included.  Use at your own risk.
